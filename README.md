### Assumptions

- One thing i assumed was that ordering the todo by its priority first was more important then ordering it by the title.
  So youll find that the todos are firstly ordered by the priority, if they are the same then its ordered by the title.


### Things I could do to improve the app

  - Put the form creation fields into the bootstrap popup modal
  - Add edit functionality to the todos
  - Add a warning message when the user tries to delete a todo, would require user to confirm deletion
  - Add confirmation messages upon creation / deletion of a todo
  - Add an error message when the user tries to add a todo without adding a title
